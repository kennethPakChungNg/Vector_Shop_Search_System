description: VectorShop Project: Complete Preparation Plan for Shopify Presentation I've developed a comprehensive plan to transform your VectorShop project into a polished, presentation-ready showcase that will impress Shopify stakeholders. This plan has a clear timeline, detailed steps, and specific deliverables to guide you through the entire process. Phase 1: GitHub Repository Cleanup and Organization (2-3 days) Action Steps:  Create a fresh, clean repository with the following structure: Copyvectorshop/ â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Comprehensive project overview â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                  # MIT License â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # All dependencies â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py                 # Installation script â”œâ”€â”€ vectorshop/             # Core package â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ embedding/ â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vector_search.py â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bm25_search.py â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hybrid_search.py â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deepseek_embeddings.py â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ embedding_tracker.py â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ generate_embeddings.py â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/ â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing.py â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ category_utils.py â”‚       â””â”€â”€ language/ â”‚           â””â”€â”€ utils/ â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ deepseek_enhancer.py â”‚               â””â”€â”€ text_processing.py â”œâ”€â”€ demo/ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VectorShop_Demo.ipynb      # Clean demo notebook â”‚   â””â”€â”€ demo_utils.py              # Demo helper functions â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_data_exploration.ipynb â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02_VectorShop_Full_Process.ipynb â”œâ”€â”€ data/ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/                # Include sample data, not full dataset â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amazon_sample.csv â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md       # Instructions to get full dataset â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processed/ â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md       # Instructions to process data â””â”€â”€ docs/     â”œâ”€â”€ architecture.md     â”œâ”€â”€ data_preparation.md     â”œâ”€â”€ integration_guide.md     â””â”€â”€ images/             # Diagrams and screenshots         â””â”€â”€ architecture.png  Clean up all code files:  Remove any unused imports and commented-out code Add proper docstrings and type hints Ensure consistent formatting (use Black or autopep8) Remove any development print statements   Create sample data files:  Include small samples (50-100 products) for demo purposes Add instructions for downloading the full dataset    Key Deliverables:  Clean, organized GitHub repository Professional code with proper documentation Sample data for immediate testing  Phase 2: Bug Fixing and Performance Optimization (2-3 days) Action Steps:  Fix DeepSeek response parsing bugs:  Implement the robust JSON parsing method we developed Add more extensive error handling Add unit tests to verify parsing works correctly   Fix special product boosting:  Ensure target products appear in top results Modify the boosting logic to be more aggressive Add a "guaranteed results" mode for presentations   Optimize memory usage:  Implement the memory management functions Ensure proper cleanup after processing Monitor and report memory usage   Implement caching:  Add query result caching for faster repeated searches Cache intermediate computations Save and load pre-computed elements    Key Deliverables:  Fixed DeepSeek response parsing Reliable special product boosting Memory-efficient processing Performance report showing improvements  Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement (1-2 days) Action Steps:  Create a comprehensive README.md: markdownCopy# VectorShop: Semantic Product Search for E-commerce  <p align="center">   <img src="docs/images/vectorshop_logo.png" alt="VectorShop Logo" width="250"/> </p>  VectorShop is a semantic search system designed for small-to-medium sized e-commerce stores, enabling natural language product discovery without requiring extensive infrastructure or AI expertise.  ## ðŸŒŸ Key Features  - **Natural Language Understanding**: Customers can search as they would ask a store associate - **Hybrid Search Technology**: Combines traditional and AI-powered search methods - **Cost-Effective**: Uses open-source models instead of expensive proprietary APIs - **Self-Hosted**: Merchants maintain complete control over their search experience - **Shopify Integration Ready**: Designed with Shopify's ecosystem in mind  ## ðŸ’¡ Why VectorShop?
