Please read through the attached our last chat summary and attached code files

I have these questions:
1. I want to demo in the full raw dataset as it only has around 1500 products so i put the raw dataset and processed into github
2. Why i cannot put the faiss file and embedding files into github as well since i use the raw datset to demo
3. i use the ai tool online to create flow chart, I attached its UI to you, could you give me a good prompt to paste in there to let it create flow chart? also where do i need to put that flow chart into in github? and how?
4. Since my laptop is very weak, i only can demo by using colab, any file need to be modified because of that? and how? check attached github files
5. may be i can use that ai flow chart generator to create explanatory diagrams for the search process? but i need a prompt for that
6. could you help to Improve the demo notebook with visual elements? code and mark down and steps instructions
7. I attached a data exploration notebook to you, do i need to add it or modify it and place in the github repository as well? and those plot do i need to cap screen place in somewhere?

I want to present this project to shopify stakeholder to try to get a job, but i know this project still need to improve before present to them right?

VectorShop Project Improvements for Stakeholder Presentation
Let me address each of your questions to help prepare your VectorShop project for a Shopify stakeholder presentation:

1. Including the Raw Dataset in GitHub
Including the raw dataset in your repository is a good idea since it's relatively small (1,500 products). This will make your demo completely self-contained and allow others to run it without needing to download additional files. Place it in the data/raw/ directory as you've planned.

2. FAISS Files and Embeddings in GitHub
You shouldn't include FAISS index files and embeddings in GitHub for several reasons:

These are binary files that can be large (potentially exceeding GitHub's 100MB file limit)
They're derived data that can be regenerated from the raw dataset
Git isn't optimized for tracking binary files (increases repository size substantially)
They may contain platform-specific optimizations that won't work across environments
Instead, modify your demo notebook to generate these files on-the-fly when needed. Include code that:

Checks if embedding files exist locally
If not, generates them from the raw data
Saves them to a location in Colab's filesystem (not in the Git repo)
3. Flow Chart Creation
Here's a prompt for generating a flow chart of the VectorShop system:


Copy
Create a detailed flow chart diagram of a hybrid product search system with these components:

1. Input: User enters natural language query (e.g., "wireless earbuds with noise cancellation under $50")

2. Query Processing Stage:
   - Query text is analyzed using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
   - System extracts product type, features, and constraints
   - Price constraints are detected

3. Parallel Search Stage:
   - BM25 (keyword search) retrieves products matching keywords
   - Vector Search using FAISS finds semantically similar products
   - Results from both approaches are combined with deduplication

4. Ranking Stage:
   - Scores are normalized and weighted
   - Category matching boosts relevant categories
   - Feature matching boosts products with requested features
   - Price filtering eliminates products exceeding constraints

5. Reranking Stage:
   - DeepSeek AI evaluates top candidates
   - Review sentiment influences final rankings
   - Final results are sorted by overall relevance score

6. Output: Ranked list of products with explanations why each matched

Use clear boxes and arrows, include color coding for different stages, and emphasize the hybrid nature of the approach combining traditional and AI methods.
Place this diagram in:

docs/images/vectorshop_architecture.png (reference file)
Include it in your README.md at the top level
Include it in docs/architecture.md with detailed explanations
Add it to your demo notebook for visualization
4. Colab-specific Modifications
For Colab compatibility, make these changes:

Add a setup cell at the beginning of your demo notebook:
python

Copy
# Setup for Colab environment
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Clone repository if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists('vectorshop'):
    !git clone https://github.com/kennethPakChungNg/vectorshop.git
    %cd vectorshop
    !pip install -e .
else:
    %cd vectorshop

# Install dependencies
!pip install -q pandas numpy torch faiss-cpu transformers sentence-transformers nltk tqdm
!pip install -q accelerate bitsandbytes
Add a cell that configures paths correctly:
python

Copy
# Configure paths for Colab
DATA_DIR = Path("data")
RAW_DATA_PATH = DATA_DIR / "raw" / "amazon.csv"
PROCESSED_DIR = DATA_DIR / "processed"
PROCESSED_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)

# Function to load dataset and handle paths
def load_data():
    import pandas as pd
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(RAW_DATA_PATH)
        print(f"Loaded {len(df)} products from {RAW_DATA_PATH}")
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data: {e}")
        return None
Update any hard-coded paths in your code to use relative paths based on the repository structure.
5. Explanatory Diagrams for Search Process
For detailed search process diagrams, use this prompt:


Copy
Create a visual explanation of the VectorShop hybrid search process with these detailed components:

1. Query Understanding (Step 1):
   - Show how "wireless earbuds with noise cancellation under $50" is processed
   - Illustrate how DeepSeek extracts: product_type="earbuds", features=["wireless", "noise cancellation"], price_constraint=50
   - Use a tree-like structure showing the parsed components

2. Dual Search Approach (Step 2):
   - Show BM25 path: query → tokenization → term matching → keyword score
   - Show Vector path: query → embedding → similarity search → semantic score
   - Demonstrate how the two approaches complement each other

3. Score Combination Process (Step 3):
   - Visual representation of normalization (showing different scales becoming comparable)
   - Weighted sum calculation (0.4*keyword_score + 0.6*vector_score)
   - Depict how feature matching adds boost scores

4. Final Ranking Method (Step 4):
   - AI reranking assessment of product relevance
   - Review sentiment analysis influence
   - Final sorting process

Include realistic examples at each stage with actual numbers and scores. Use distinct colors for different pipeline components, and show numerical values changing through the process stages.
Place the resulting diagrams in docs/images/ and reference them in your documentation and demo.

6. Improving the Demo Notebook
Let me provide a structure to enhance your demo notebook:

7. Data Exploration Notebook
Yes, you should include the data exploration notebook in your GitHub repository. It adds significant value by showing your analytical process and insights about the dataset. Here's how to handle it:

Include the notebook: Add it to your repository in the notebooks/ directory as 01_data_exploration.ipynb.
Save visualizations:
Save key visualizations as PNG files in a docs/images/ directory
Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., category_distribution.png, price_analysis.png)
Caption each visualization in the notebook with clear explanations
Include a summary of insights: At the end of the notebook, add a "Key Insights" section that summarizes the most important findings about your dataset.
Reference in documentation: Include references to this notebook in your README.md and link to specific visualizations in your other documentation.
Clean the notebook: Before committing, make sure to:
Run all cells so outputs are visible
Remove any experimental or debug code
Add clear markdown explanations between code sections
