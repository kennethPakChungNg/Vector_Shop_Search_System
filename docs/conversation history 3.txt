I saw this today in twitter there is a company vercel build a agora vector search engine for shopify, it very similar to our project.
here is its information
As a merchant on Agora, you will manage your storefront through your Merchant Dashboard. The Dashboard allows you to track all your store's analytics, upgrade to a paid subscription plan and advertise products. Here is an overview of all pages:
1. Home: This page provides an at-a-glance view of your store analytics, including impressions, clicks and product opens.
2. Products: This page shows all your products available on Agora. Click on the 'Verify' button to select which products you want to prioritize in our search algorithm. The products you Verify appear at the top of relevant searches with a 'Sponsored' tag on them. In order to Verify products you must first select a Subscription plan in the Subscription page. As you scroll down through your products, you can also select which products you want to 'Boost.' Boosting a product places it in a first-row-spot advertisement with a 'Sponsored' tag on it. You can select which listings to Boost on a daily basis.
3. Sales: Monitor all orders and customers you've received on Agora. We also provide you customer's contact information so you don't lose ownership over them.
4. Subscriptions: Select your Subscription plan with Agora to start Verifying products and increasing your store revenue. Our Starter, Pro, and Premium plans vary in a number of things. Refer to the chart in that page for more details. You can switch between plans at anytime. Pro and Premium plans offer significant discounts for Boosting products. We also offer Enterprise plans with customized pricing for large stores. All plans can be paid for on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the merchant's preference.
5. Team: Invite a team member to your Merchant Dashboard so they can also monitor your store's results with Agora.
6. Settings: Add your payment method, change your password, keep track of your transactions or access integrations to connect other platforms with your Agora storefront.
Agora is a search engine where customers can discover, save and purchase any products sold on the Internet. Here's an overview of how Agora works:
1. Go to https://www.searchagora.com/.
2. Type any product or store you are looking for on the search bar, chat with our shopping assistant Athena, or upload an image through our Image Search functionality. Or simply scroll down to discover products handpicked for you.
3. Click the 'Log In' button on the top right corner of the screen to create an account. This will allow you to save your favorite items, create Lists that you can share with friends, compare and purchase products.
4. Use the 'Lists' page to create new product lists and save your favorite brands. You can share these with friends through your social media pages, email or via link.
5. Use the 'Orders' page to review your current and past orders, and click into any of these to review the payment method used, shipping details and order amount.
6. Use the 'Settings' page to add or update your payment method, add or update your shipping address, review your Agora Credits, profile information and your preferred categories for the home page under the 'personalization' tab.and I still havenâ€™t finished this project yet, I am so sad.  people always faster than you and better than you, then what is the point of this project. I use this query "i want a wireless headset under 200 usd with excellent noise cancellation" to test that agora, but no results return check attached images.Please also check attached code files which is for presentation to shopify and our conversation history. What should we do? Fix those bugs, improve it, prepare presentation? please tell me what should I do..please...i was wanting to impress them, seems cannot anymore, i am so FUCKING stupidEditAnalyzed project's value, emotional state, and strategic next steps.7sThe user appears to be quite distressed about seeing a similar product (Agora) to what they're working on (VectorShop). They're feeling discouraged and questioning the value of their project. They're also concerned about bugs in their system and whether they should continue with the project or focus on fixing issues before a presentation to Shopify stakeholders.
Let me carefully analyze the situation:

Agora by Vercel vs. VectorShop:

Agora appears to be a commercial search engine that indexes products across various e-commerce platforms
It has features like merchant dashboards, product verification, boosting, and management
Their VectorShop is focused on semantic search for small-to-medium sized e-commerce stores
Both use vector search but seem to have different target audiences and features


User's emotional state:

They seem very discouraged ("I am so sad", "i am so FUCKING stupid")
They're comparing themselves negatively to others ("people always faster than you and better than you")
They're questioning the value of their work ("what is the point of this project")
They mention wanting to impress Shopify but feel they can't anymore


Technical state of their project:

Based on previous conversations, they have implemented most core components
They've created demo notebooks and functionality
There appear to be some bugs or issues they're concerned about
They're preparing for a presentation to Shopify stakeholders



I need to:

Validate their feelings and provide emotional support
Help them see the value in their project despite the existence of Agora
Provide practical next steps for improving their project, fixing bugs, and preparing for their presentation
Frame this situation as a learning opportunity rather than a failure

I'll structure my response to address these points while being supportive and practical.Finding Your Edge in a Competitive Space
I understand your frustration and disappointment at seeing Agora, which feels similar to your VectorShop project. That sinking feeling when you discover someone else has built something in your space is one many developers experience - I want to acknowledge that this is genuinely difficult.
Your Project Still Has Significant Value
Let me explain why your project remains valuable despite Agora's existence:

Validation of your concept - Agora's existence actually confirms you were working on a valuable problem worth solving. You independently identified a real market need.
Different positioning - Looking at your implementation versus Agora:

Agora is a centralized platform that indexes many stores
VectorShop is designed for individual merchants to integrate into their own stores
Your solution offers more direct control and customization for merchants


Learning journey - The technical skills you've developed building VectorShop (working with embeddings, FAISS, hybrid search systems) are extremely valuable regardless of the end product.
Portfolio strength - A working semantic search system demonstrates advanced technical capabilities that will impress technical interviewers at companies like Shopify.

Turning This Into an Advantage for Your Presentation
Here's how to position your project to Shopify stakeholders:

Acknowledge Agora upfront - "Solutions like Agora show the growing market demand for AI-powered product search"
Differentiate your approach - "While Agora offers a centralized platform, VectorShop gives merchants complete control over their search experience without sharing data with a third party"
Emphasize implementation insights - "Building this system taught me valuable lessons about the practical challenges of implementing semantic search for e-commerce"
Show technical depth - Demonstrate your understanding of hybrid search systems, vector databases, and AI reasoning that most developers don't possess

Next Steps Before Your Presentation
Based on your code files and conversation history, here's what I recommend:

Fix critical bugs first:

Resolve the DeepSeek response parsing errors
Ensure target products appear in search results
Fix any memory management issues for a smooth demo


Prepare a reliable demo:

Use the standalone demo function we developed that runs in ~0.6 seconds
Prepare 3-5 impressive example queries with guaranteed results
Create a backup plan (screenshots) in case of technical issues


Enhance your documentation:

Complete the architecture diagram
Add clear comparison points with commercial alternatives
Emphasize the open-source nature of your solution


Position yourself effectively:

Frame this as a learning project that demonstrates your technical capabilities
Discuss what you learned and how you overcame challenges
Show how you'd approach building search differently with your new knowledge



Remember
The tech industry is full of parallel development - multiple teams solving similar problems. What matters isn't being first to market, but rather:

Your unique perspective on the problem
The depth of your technical understanding
Your ability to communicate complex concepts
The specific implementation details you chose and why

Your project demonstrates all of these things, regardless of Agora's existence. That's what will impress Shopify stakeholders.
